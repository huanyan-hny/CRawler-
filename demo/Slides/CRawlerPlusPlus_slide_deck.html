# Why crawler?

The coming week is the reading week.

--

You are busy at Bulter ~~watching Columbia Buy Sell Memes~~ preparing for exams.


<a href="url"><img src="img/meme.png" align="middle" height="400"></a>

--

You feel hungry, but you are too lazy to go grab food.

--

What to do?

--
Order Seamless!

---

# Why crawler?

But you are even too lazy to look at Seamless. You'd rather just pick a restaurant and order all of its most popular food under $15 bucks.

--

What to do now? 

--
Write a .red[*crawler*] to scrape everything down from Seamless for you!

--

Wait... what is a crawler? And wouldn't that be more work?

--

Not at all!

### HTTP in 2 minutes

---

# The language that client and server talks in

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has two main components: request and response.

--

Let's read a HTTP **request**:
```HTTP
GET /Bjarne.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: www.stroustrup.com
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Chrome/57.0.2987.133
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;
```
--

It says:

- I want to .red[GET] a file called .red[/Bjarne.jpg] from the host .red[www.stroustrup.com].
- I want to keep the connection between us .red[alive].
- I am a .red[Chrome] browser.
- I accept the following response, including picture (.red[image/webp]).
- I accept English as the language.

---

# The language that client and server talks in

And here's the **response** from the server:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 Okay
Date: Fri, 28 Apr 2017 05:51:09 GMT
Server: Apache
Connection: Keep-Alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100
Set-Cookie: sessionid=38afes7a8; httponly; Path=/
```

--

It says:

- I received your request and the .red[status] now is Okay.
- I documented the .red[timestamp] our connection happens.
- I am an .red[Apache] server.
- I will keep our connection .red[alive], but after .red[5] seconds if the connection is idle I will close it.
- In each persistent connection, you can make a maximum of .red[100] requests.
- And here's a piece of .red[cookie] information. Put that in your cookie jar and let me know your .red[sessionid] next time when we talk.

Easy? Good!

---

# How is this related to web crawler

Definition : 
"_A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering)._" (Wikipedia)

--

In short, a web crawler will go to designated websites and make .red[requests] on behalf of you.

--

It will then .red[parse the response] according to your requirement.

--

And .red[iterate, iterate, iterate].

### Motivation

# Many people told us not to do that...

- A list of "Dozens of awesome C++ libraries": .red[not even one of them] is a crawler library (https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp)

- Google search for "C++ crawler", it's either code snippets from ancient (7 yrs old or above), or something like below:

# But we view this as an opportunity

- C++ has changed: Modern C++ is more expressive than ever.
- Async IO has become more mature -- and C++ has great control at system-level.
- C++ is fast. Much faster than python.
- C++ is strongly typed, so it catches errors earlier -- You don't want to waste all day (and network resources) downloading garbage before realizing it.

---

# Purpose of this library:

- To address the need of a crawler library in C++
- To showcase that Modern C++ is not as bad as people thought in handling network / string parsing / crawler job

# Key terms

- Engine
	- The multithreaded **brain** that connects all the components and manages them.
- Scheduler 
	- Schedule the task, manage depth, duplication, etc. 
- Item & Item Pipeline
	- Item is the (well-structured) data to be stored
	- It can be image, json, txt, key-value pairs... anything
	- Item pipeline handles data persistence
- Task & Downloader
	- A task unit contains all enough information for downloader to perform the task
	- e.g.: request_method, session_name, authentication info
- Spider
	- Do the parsing of the HTTP response (either HTML or JSON)
	- Get items to be stored
	- Get future tasks to be performed
	- Powered by in-house parsing library (very handy!)

## Truly optional constructor - Solution 0: Traditional Approach

```cpp
Task::Task(string _url,
           spider_callback _callback,
           Request_method _method, 
           Request_content _content ,
           Session_type _session_type, 
           string _session_name ,
           Auth_type _auth_type ,
           Authentication _auth, 
           Form _form , 
           Header _header);
                    
auto T = Task("http://google.com", 
				nullptr, 
				Request_method::GET, 
				Request_content::HTML, 
				Session_type::AUTO, 
				"", 
				Auth_type::None, 
				Authentication("",""), 
				Form {}, 
				Header {}); 
// Long and tedious ... many things are the same in most of the time!
```
---

## Truly optional constructor - Solution 1: Default Value
```cpp

auto T = Task("http://google.com", nullptr); // Yeah everything else is optional now!

// What if I want to specify the session name?

auto T2 = Task("http://google.com",
					nullptr, 
					Request_method::GET, 
					Request_content::HTML, 
					Session_type::NEW,
					"new_session"); 
/* Shoot -- I just want to specify the session name, 
 * but will have to write all the previous default value explicitly! */
```
---

## Truly optional constructor - Solution 2: Constructor with default value + set_x methods
```cpp
Task::Task(string _url,
           spider_callback _callback,
           Request_method _method, 
           Request_content _content ,
           Session_type _session_type, 
           string _session_name ,
           Auth_type _auth_type ,
           Authentication _auth, 
           Form _form , 
           Header _header);
           
auto T2 = Task("http://google.com", nullptr);
T2.set_session_type(Session_type::LAST);

auto T3 = Task("http://google.com", 
				  nullptr, 
				  Request_content::FILE, 
				  Request_method::POST, 
				  Session_type::LAST); // error

/* error -- but why does it even matter??
 * The library should be smart enough to understand what's going on! */
```
---

## Truly optional constructor - Our approach
```cpp
template <typename... Tail>
Task(string _url, spider_callback _callback, Tail... tail): url(_url), callback(_callback)
{
    method = Request_method::GET;
    content = Request_content::HTML;
    session_type = Session_type::DEFAULT;
    session_name = "";
    auth = Authentication("","");
    form = {};
    Crawler_Util::set_option(*this, tail...);
}

#define FWD(...) ::std::forward<decltype(__VA_ARGS__)>(__VA_ARGS__)

template <typename C>
void set_option(C& c) { // base case
}

template <typename C, typename T, typename... Ts>
void set_option(C& c, T&& t, Ts&&... ts) {
    set_option(c, FWD(t));
    set_option(c, FWD(ts)...);
}

template <typename C, typename T>
void set_option(C& c, T&& t) {
    c.set_option(FWD(t));
}

auto T3 = Task("http://google.com", 
				  nullptr, 
				  Request_content::FILE, 
				  Request_method::POST, 
				  Session_type::LAST); // Now it works!
```
---

## Truly optional constructor - Pros and Cons

Pros: 

- User does not need to call set_option explicitly
- the ordering does not matter anymore!
- forwarding will handle both l-value and r-value

Cons:

- For library implementer it’s a bit more work
- Different options must be of different type (otherwise, how does util function know which set_option to call, if there’s many matches?)

---

## Callback Implementation -- Motivation

When we get some HTTP requests to parse, they may came from different sources as well as have different type. 

--

The user may design multiple handler to deal with different kinds of HTTP responses. 

--

Therefore, we don’t want to associate the handler with some specific functions, but rather, we want each task to "know" which function to be called once it is done.

--

Essentially, we want a callback mechanism!

---

## Callback Implementation -- typedef and issue

The callback mechanism is implemented by the std::function. We defined our callback as:  

```cpp
typedef function<void(shared_ptr<Task>,
					  shared_ptr<Response>,
					  function<void(Task&)>,
					  function<void(Item&)>)> spider_callback;
```

The callback function need to be defined in the class which derives from the Spider class. It must have the same parameters like the example showed above. 

--

The address of a callback function could be retrieved by &ClassName::Callback. 

--

.red[Issue with this]: However, the function pointer of the callback couldn’t be converted to the spider_callback because as the member function pointer inside a class, it could only be converted to the std::function, which must contain a parameter with type ClassName& or ClassName*. Whenever the std::function is invoked, an instance of the class has to be passed in.

---

## Callback Implementation -- Solution

In order to make that function address conform to our spider_callback, we need a helper function:

```cpp
template<class T> spider_callback callback(void (T::* callback)
  (shared_ptr<Task>,shared_ptr<Response>,function<void(Task&)>,function<void(Item&)>))
{
    return std::bind(callback, 
    					 (T*)this, 
    					 std::placeholders::_1,  
    					 std::placeholders::_2,
    					 std::placeholders::_3,
    					 std::placeholders::_4);
}
```

Now we can define callback handler as below:

```cpp
void parse(shared_ptr<Task> task, 
			shared_ptr<Response> res,
			function<void(Task&)> add_task, 
			function<void(Item&)> produce_item)
```

and then associate the function with the new task.

```cpp
Task("www.google.com",callback(&IMDBSpider::parse))
```
---

# Yield-like behaviour -- Problem definition

In the handler, we suppose user to produce new tasks and new items.

--

At first, we require the user to return a vector, which includes all of the data we are going to pass back to the engine, but it tends to be unfriendly to the user:

```cpp
// This code needed in every add task parser!

{
  vector<shared_ptr<Task>> ret;
  ret.push_back(make_shared<Task>(Task("www.google.com",callback(&IMDBSpider::parse)));
  return ret;
}
```

---

# Yield-like behaviour -- Solution

In the Spider class, we wrapped the user’s functions, passed two callback functions to user, which are implemented in the lambda function. 

--

Basically, it pushes the item user returned into the pre-defined vector. Every time the user calls the callback, one item will be pushed into the vector. After the user handled all of the objects, the helper function returned the vector back to the engine:

Inspired by the Python yield return mechanism, we gave the user callback function to achieve yield-like behavior:

```cpp
// Defined in Spider base case; Engine calls this
vector<shared_ptr<Task>> Spider::initial_tasks_wrapper()
{
    vector<shared_ptr<Task>> ret;
    initial_tasks([&](Task& req){
        ret.push_back(make_shared<Task>(req));
    } );
    return ret;
}

// In user-defined spider, do the following will be enough!
add_task(Task("www.google.com",callback(&IMDBSpider::parse));
```
---

# Async IO -- Usage of std::async

```cpp

atomic_fetch_add(&active_threads, 1);
std::async(std::launch::async, [&](shared_ptr<Task> task)
{
	Task t = *task;
	shared_ptr<Response> res = cd.get(*task);
	std::async(std::launch::async, [&](shared_ptr<Task> old_tsk, shared_ptr<Response> res) {
		auto result = spider->parse_wrapper(old_tsk,res);
		vector<shared_ptr<Item>> items = result.items;
		vector<shared_ptr<Task>> reqs = result.next_reqs;
		scheduler->add_requests(reqs,old_tsk);
		item_pipeline->handle_items(items);
		atomic_fetch_add(&active_threads, -1);
	},task,res);
},task));
```
---

# Async IO -- How to handle feature

- The std::async will return a std::future. The std::future will wait itself to finish in its destructor. 
- If we lose the reference: the statements below the std::async call will be blocked until the std::async finished, even if you don’t care the return value of the std::feature.

--

- **Solution**: To make the std::async “asynchronous”, we have to use a vector to store all of the std::future generated by the std::async and clean them periodically. 

- Maybe a better way? detach()?

---

# Implementation of HTML Parser

Let's start with a HTML source code:

```html
<div>
    <span class="row">
        <div id="item1">Banana</div>
        <div id="item2">Apple</div>
        <div id="item3">Google</div>
    </span>
</div>
```
How should we model that?

```cpp

class HTML {
    public:
        vector<HTML> extract(string path, bool isLast); 
        vector<HTML> find_by_xpath(string xpath);
        vector<HTML> find_all(string tag, string selectors);
        ...
    private:
        string src;
        ...
}
```

# Similarly, for JSON Parser...

From:

```json

{   "name":"Sample",
    "intValue":42,
    "boolValue":true,
    "jsonValue":{ "name":"AnotherSample", "level":2},
    "listValue":["a",2,false,[1],{"a":"b"}] }
```

To:

```cpp
class JSON {
    public:
        JSON operator[](string key); ///< Overloaded operator for mapValue access
        JSON operator[](int index);
        static JSON parse(string jsonString){...}
        vector<JSON> find_by_key(string key);
        string toString();
        size_t size();
        int getInt();
        ...
    private:
        string type;
        unordered_map<string, JSON> mapValue;
        string stringvalue;
        int intValue;
        double doubleValue;
        bool boolValue;
        vector<JSON> listValue;
        ...
}
```

---

# Design choice

- Member Access
- Opearator [] method
- Opearator [] method again (overloading with int argument)
- find_by_key returns a JSON object
